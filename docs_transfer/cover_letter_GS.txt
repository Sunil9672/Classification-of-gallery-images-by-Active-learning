Dear Recruitment Team,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Goldman Sachs. With a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay and nearly four years of experience at Jio Platforms Limited, I bring strong expertise in building and deploying large-scale distributed systems using Java, Spark, Kafka, and other core technologies aligned with this role’s expectations.

At Jio, I designed and deployed high-throughput, Java-based microservices that offloaded compute-heavy tasks to Apache Spark clusters—leading to a 50% improvement in user request throughput (TPS). I have hands-on experience managing real-time event pipelines using Kafka and optimizing them for fault tolerance and minimal latency. By applying multithreading and asynchronous programming in Java, I reduced average system latency by 40% and improved throughput by 20%.

Additionally, I built and maintained Elasticsearch infrastructure processing 30GB-300GB of daily event traffic, implementing efficient shard strategies and in-memory caching with Redis to improve system responsiveness by 32%. This experience honed my skills in designing scalable, fault-resilient systems—critical for the performance and reliability standards expected in financial infrastructure.

I’ve also worked on deep learning services such as SPAM SMS Detector  using optimized ONNX weights, Ray Serve, and LLMs with RAG-based architectures, giving me a well-rounded understanding of backend systems and intelligent service design.

Goldman Sachs’ emphasis on resilient, scalable systems for large-scale event processing deeply resonates with my experience and technical mindset. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to build core engineering products that power critical workflows across the firm, and I’m eager to contribute to a team known for its engineering excellence.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background can contribute to the success of Goldman Sachs’ platform engineering initiatives.

Sincerely,
Sunil Meena

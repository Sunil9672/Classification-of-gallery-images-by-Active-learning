Total Income = 28.2L


For old regime, After 50K(compulsory deduction),
80k(medical insr.), 2.1L(rent),
2.76(house loan), 3.5L(political donation) deductions from 
total income, 18.56L remains as net income.
so, tax on the remaining income, (18.56L - 15L)*0.3 = 1.07L

net tax for old regime = 0.125+0.2+0.3+0.3+0.2+0.6+0.9+1.07 = 3.695

For new regime, After 50Kcompulsory deductions from 
total income, 27.70L remains as net income.
so, tax on the remaining income, (27.70L - 15L)*0.3 = 3.81L

net tax for new regime = 0.125+0.05+0.15+0.15+0.15+0.3+0.6+3.81 = 5.34L


new regime tax - old regime tax = 5.34-3.7 = 1.635

20K given to political party => net tax saved compared to new is 1.635
